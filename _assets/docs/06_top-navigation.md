### **Explanation of the Addition: `layouts/includes/TopNav.tsx`**

#### **What is `TopNav.tsx`?**
The `TopNav` component is a **custom top navigation bar** for the application. It serves as the header and includes interactive elements like a logo, a search bar, a login button, and user menu options.

---

### **Key Features in `TopNav.tsx`**

1. **Logo Link**
   ```tsx
   <Link href="/">
       <img src="/images/logo.png" className="min-w-[115px] w-[115px]" />
   </Link>
   ```
   - Displays the logo and links it to the homepage.

2. **Search Bar**
   - Uses an input field to allow users to search for "accounts."
   - The `handleSearchName` function logs the input value to the console when the user types.
   - A dropdown under the search bar demonstrates search results with a placeholder link to a profile.

3. **Upload Button**
   ```tsx
   <button onClick={() => goTo()} className="flex items-center border rounded-sm py-[6px] hover:bg-gray-100 pl-1.5">
       <AiOutlinePlus color="#000000" size="22" />
       <span className="px-2 font-medium text-[15px]">Upload</span>
   </button>
   ```
   - This button triggers the `goTo` function (currently logging `'here'`) and can be expanded for uploading content in the future.

4. **Login/Account Menu**
   - If the user is **not logged in**, a "Log In" button is displayed along with a vertical dots icon.
   - If the user **is logged in** (currently hardcoded as `true`), a user profile picture is displayed with a dropdown menu for "Profile" and "Log Out" options.

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Uses Tailwind CSS classes to ensure the navigation is responsive (e.g., hiding the search bar on smaller screens with `hidden md:flex`).

6. **Icons**
   - Leverages `react-icons` for various icons (`AiOutlinePlus`, `BiSearch`, `BiUser`, `FiLogOut`, etc.), making the navigation bar visually appealing and intuitive.

### **Explanation of the Update: Importing `TopNav` into `MainLayout`**

#### **What Changed in `MainLayout.tsx`?**
```tsx
import TopNav from "./includes/TopNav";

export default function MainLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    const pathname = usePathname();
    return (
        <>
            <TopNav />
            <div className={`flex justify-between mx-auto w-full lg:px-2.5 px-0 ${pathname == '/' ? 'max-w-[1140px]' : ''}`}>
                {children}
            </div>
        </>
    );
}
```
- **`TopNav` was added to `MainLayout`**, making the navigation bar a persistent part of the app's layout.
- Now, all pages using `MainLayout` will automatically include the `TopNav` at the top of the page.

---

### **How It Works Together**
1. **Persistent Header**:
   - The `TopNav` component is rendered at the top of the layout, providing navigation, search, and account functionality across all pages.

2. **Dynamic Page Layout**:
   - Below the `TopNav`, the existing layout dynamically adjusts its width depending on the current route (`pathname`), ensuring consistency in design.

3. **Reusability**:
   - By integrating `TopNav` into `MainLayout`, you ensure that the navigation bar is consistent across all pages without the need to include it manually in each page component.

---

### **Benefits of This Approach**
1. **Centralized Navigation**:
   - Ensures consistent navigation across all pages by including `TopNav` in the layout.

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Handles search visibility and layout adjustments across different screen sizes with Tailwind CSS.

3. **Future Extensibility**:
   - `TopNav` is modular and can be expanded with additional features, such as user authentication or advanced search.

4. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Features like a dynamic search bar, account dropdowns, and easy access to the homepage enhance usability.

By adding `TopNav` to `MainLayout`, the app gains a cohesive, responsive, and reusable navigation component that will scale well with additional pages and features.
